# Homework Week 3 Password Generator Michael Ariti

## Password Generator

The purpose of this repository is to create a basic portfolio that will be expanded on in the future. The portfolio is for the author showing off multiple projects, at the moment however there is only one live project, so several have placeholder images and will just re-link to the portfolio itself.

## File Directory
